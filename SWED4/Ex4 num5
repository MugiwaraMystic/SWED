Interface-Based Design
  . Description: Define interfaces for services and models to depend 
    on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.

  . Benefit: Enhances flexibility and interchangeability of components.


Dependency Injection
  . Description: Use dependency injection to provide dependencies to classes instead of 
    creating instances within the classes. This can be manual or through a DI framework like Spring.

  . Benefit: Improves testability and decouples the instantiation logic from usage logic.

Event-Driven Architecture
  . Description: Implement an event-driven architecture where components communicate through events.
  . Benefit: Decouples the sender and receiver, allowing independent evolution of components.

Service Locator Pattern
  . Description: Use a service locator to provide a central registry 
    for classes to request services without knowing their implementations.

  . Benefit: Centralizes service management and reduces direct dependencies.

Modularization
  . Description: Divide the application into modules with well-defined interfaces and 
    limit the visibility of internal components, using Java 9 modules for strong encapsulation.

  . Benefit: Enforces encapsulation and reduces inter-module dependencies.

Facade Pattern
  . Description: Provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem using the facade pattern.

  . Benefit: Reduces the number of dependencies on the subsystem and simplifies interactions.
